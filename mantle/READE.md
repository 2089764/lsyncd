This is the Lsyncd "mantle"
===========================

This is where all general operation logic is coded in the Lua language.

The Lsyncd core written in C handles system glue and is designed to be
as slim as possible.

The logic for rsync(ssh) handling is written as sync handles provided
by default in the default directory.
